<font face="verdana">Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (b. 1813, d. 1855) was a profound and prolific writer in the Danish “golden age” of intellectual and artistic activity. His work crosses the boundaries of philosophy, theology, psychology, literary criticism, devotional literature and fiction. Kierkegaard brought this potent mixture of discourses to bear as social critique and for the purpose of renewing Christian faith within Christendom.  At the same time he made many original conceptual contributions to each of the disciplines he employed. He is known as the “father of existentialism”, but at least as important are his critiques of Hegel and of the German romantics, his contributions to the development of modernism, his stylistic experimentation, his vivid re-presentation of biblical figures to bring out their modern relevance, his invention of key concepts which have been explored and redeployed by thinkers ever since, his interventions in contemporary Danish church politics, and his fervent attempts to analyse and revitalise Christian faith.</font>

**索伦·奥比·克尔凯郭尔**（1813-1855）是[丹麦黄金时代](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B8%B9%E9%BA%A6%E9%BB%84%E9%87%91%E6%97%B6%E4%BB%A3)的一位深刻而多产的作家。他的作品跨越了哲学、神学、心理学、文学批评、宗教文学与小说的边界。为了革新基督教信仰，克尔凯郭尔以这种混合话语对基督教世界进行了强有力的社会批判。与此同时，对他所从事的每个学科，克氏都做出过众多原创性的概念贡献。他因作为“存在主义之父”而广为人知，然而他还做过许多更重要的事情：他对于黑格尔与德国浪漫主义的批判，他对现代主义做出的杰出贡献，他的实验性文学风格，他在现代意义上对圣经人物的鲜活再现，他发明的那些被思想家探索与重新理解的重要概念，他对当代丹麦教会政治的强有力干涉、他对基督教信仰分析与复兴的激情尝试。

###### <font face="verdanna">1. Kierkegaard’s Life</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard led a somewhat uneventful life. He rarely left his hometown of Copenhagen, and travelled abroad only five times—four times to Berlin and once to Sweden. His prime recreational activities were attending the theatre, walking the streets of Copenhagen to chat with ordinary people, and taking brief carriage jaunts into the surrounding countryside. He was educated at a prestigious boys’ school (<i>Borgerdydskolen</i>), then attended Copenhagen University where he studied philosophy and theology. His teachers at the university included F.C. Sibbern, Poul Martin Møller, and H.L. Martensen.</font>

克尔凯郭尔的生活并非跌宕起伏、充满激情。他很少离开哥本哈根，一生仅仅出国五次——四次柏林和一次瑞典。克氏主要的休闲运动是：去剧院听歌剧；在哥本哈根的街头闲逛，与普通人聊天；乘坐短途马车游历乡村。他在一所著名的男校接受教育，后来升学至哥本哈根大学修习哲学与神学。他在哥大的老师有：[F.C. 西伯恩](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Christian_Sibbern)、[保罗·马丁·穆勒](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Martin_M%C3%B8ller)、[H.L. 马滕森](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Lassen_Martensen)。

<font face="verdana">Sibbern and Møller were both philosophers who also wrote fiction. The latter in particular had a great influence on Kierkegaard’s philosophico-literary development. Martensen also had a profound effect on Kierkegaard, but largely in a negative manner. Martensen was a champion of Hegelianism, and when he became Bishop Primate of the Danish People’s Church, Kierkegaard published a vitriolic attack on Martensen’s theological views. Kierkegaard’s brother Peter, on the other hand, was an adherent of Martensen and himself became a bishop. Kierkegaard regarded Martensen as one of his chief intellectual rivals. Martensen was only five years his senior, but was already lecturing at Copenhagen University when Kierkegaard was a student there. Martensen also anticipated Kierkegaard’s first major literary project, by publishing a book on Faust. Kierkegaard, who had been working up a project on the three great medieval figures of Don Juan, Faust and Ahasuerus (the wandering Jew), abandoned his own project when Martensen’s book appeared, although he later incorporated much of the work he had done into <i>Either/Or</i>.</font>

西伯恩和穆勒都是写小说的哲学家，后者对克氏的哲学文学风格的发展影响很深。马滕森也对克氏有着深远的影响，不过主要是负面的。马滕森是黑格尔主义者，克氏在马滕森当选丹麦人民教会的主教时，对其观点发起尖锐的批评。克尔凯郭尔的哥哥——[彼得·克尔凯郭尔](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kierkegaard)是马滕森的拥护者，后来也成为了主教。克氏将马滕森视作他主要的智识上的对手之一。马滕森只比克氏大五岁，但在克氏就读于哥大时，就已经开始任教。通过出版一本关于[《浮士德》](https://book.douban.com/subject/24295354/)的书，（在这场看不见的战争中）马滕森领先于克氏第一个重要的文学研究。克尔凯郭尔一直在研究唐璜、浮士德和亚伯拉罕（流浪的犹太人）这三位中世纪伟大的人物——马滕森的书出版之后，他放弃了自己的计划，尽管这些成果大都被纳入到[《非此即彼》](https://book.douban.com/subject/3987027/)中。

<font face="verdana">Another very important figure in Kierkegaard’s life was J.L. Heiberg, the doyen of Copenhagen’s literati. Heiberg, more than any other person, was responsible for introducing Hegelianism into Denmark. Kierkegaard spent a good deal of energy trying to break into the Heiberg literary circle, but desisted once he had found his own voice in <i>The Concept of Irony</i>. Kierkegaard’s first major publication, <i>From the Papers of One Still Living</i>, is largely an attempt to articulate a Heibergian aesthetics—which is a modified version of Hegel’s aesthetics. In <i>From the Papers of One Still Living</i>, which is a critical review of Hans Christian Andersen’s novel <i>Only A Fiddler</i>, Kierkegaard attacks Andersen for lacking life-development (<i>Livs-Udvikling</i>) and an outlook on life (<i>Livs-Anskuelse</i>) both of which Kierkegaard deemed necessary for someone to be a genuine novelist (<i>Romandigter</i>).</font>

在克氏生命中另一个重要人物是 [J.L. 海贝格](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johan_Ludvig_Heiberg_(historian))，哥本哈根学派的元老。海贝格比其他人更应该肩负这个责任：将黑格尔主义介绍到丹麦。为进入海贝格文人圈子，克尔凯郭尔花费了很多精力，这尝试停止于他发现自己的声音——[《论反讽的概念》](https://book.douban.com/subject/1506334/)时。克氏发表的第一本书是[《尚存者手记》](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/46455)，本书很大程度上是阐明海贝格美学——黑格尔美学的修改版——的尝试。在《尚存者手记》——主要是对安徒生的《不过是个提琴手》的批判性评论——中，克氏攻击安徒生缺少人生观<sup>（采取《克尔凯郭尔传》第 127 页的翻译）</sup>，而人生观是一个天才小说作家所必备的品质。<small>（天才不是在风中熄灭的蜡烛，而是熊熊的烈火，风暴只会让它越烧越旺）</small>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s life is more relevant to his work than is the case for many writers. Much of the thrust of his critique of Hegelianism is that its system of thought is abstracted from the everyday lives of its proponents. This existential critique consists in demonstrating how the life and work of a philosopher contradict one another. Kierkegaard derived this form of critique from the Greek notion of judging philosophers by their lives rather than simply by their intellectual artefacts. The Christian ideal, according to Kierkegaard, is even more exacting since the totality of an individual’s existence is the artefact on the basis of which s/he is judged by God for h/er eternal validity. Of course a writer’s work is an important part of h/er existence, but for the purpose of judgement we should focus on the whole life not just on one part.</font>

相比于其他作家，克氏的生活与他的作品之间的联系更为紧密。他对于黑格尔主义批判的思想体系，有很多是从黑格尔主义者的日常生活中抽象出来的。此类存在主义式的批判在于证明：哲学家的生活与工作是相互矛盾的。克氏通过希腊哲学家的生活中推导出这个命题，而不是仅从哲学家的智识成果中得到的。根据克氏的观点，基督教的理想甚至更加严格，因为个体的所有存在是艺术品，而上帝会根据其存在来判断 Ta 的不朽性。当然，作品是一个作家存在的重要部分，但是出于（与上帝相同角度）判断的目的，我们应当着眼于作家生命的全部，而不仅是作品。

<font face="verdana">In a less abstract manner, an understanding of Kierkegaard’s biography is important for an understanding of his writing because his life was the source of many of the preoccupations and repetitions within his <i>oeuvre</i>. Because of his existentialist orientation, most of his interventions in contemporary theory do double duty as means of working through events from his own life. In particular Kierkegaard’s relations to his father and his fiancée Regine Olsen pervade his work. Kierkegaard’s pseudonym Johannes Climacus says of Socrates that “his whole life was personal preoccupation with himself, and then Governance comes and adds world-historical significance to it.” Similarly, Kierkegaard saw himself as a “singular universal” whose personal preoccupation with himself was transfigured by divine Governance into universal significance.</font>

换言之，要理解克尔凯郭尔，就必须阅读传记，因为他的生活是其作品的许多关注点与重复的根源。因为他的存在主义倾向，他在现代理论中出现时，其理论往往被认作是解决自己生活的问题的手段，具有双重作用。特别是作为儿子与父亲、作为恋人与雷吉娜的关系不断对他的作品施加影响。在假名“攀登者约翰内斯”的面具下，克氏在谈到苏格拉底时说：“他的整个生命都被他的自我所占据，后来‘治理者’<sup>指上帝</sup>来临，让其具有历史性的普世意义。”相似地，克氏将他自己认作是“作为个体的普遍性”，他对自我的认知在那神圣的治理之下转换为那普世的。

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s relation to his mother is the least frequently commented upon since it is invisible in his work. His mother does not rate a direct mention in his published works, or in his diaries—not even on the day she died. However, for a writer who places so much emphasis on indirect communication, and on the semiotics of invisibility, we should regard this absence as significant. Johannes Climacus in <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i> remarks, “… how deceptive then, that an omnipresent being should be recognisable precisely by being invisible.” Although Kierkegaard’s mother is absent, his mother-tongue (<i>Modersmaal</i>—etymologically derived from the words for “mother” and “measure”) is almost omnipresent. Kierkegaard was deeply enamoured of the Danish language and worked throughout his writings to assert the strengths of his mother-tongue over the invasive, imperialistic influences of Latin and German. With respect to the former, Kierkegaard had to petition the king to be allowed to write his philosophy dissertation <i>On the Concept of Irony with constant reference to Socrates</i> in Danish. Even though permission was granted he was still required to defend his dissertation publicly in Latin. Latin had been the pan-European language of science and scholarship. In Denmark, in Kierkegaard’s time, German language and culture were at least as dominant as Latin in the production of knowledge. In defiance of this, Kierkegaard revelled in his mother-tongue and created some of the most beautifully poetic prose in the Danish language—including a paean to his mother-tongue in <i>Stages On Life’s Way</i>. In <i>Repetition</i> (1843), the character and pseudonymous author Constantin Constantius congratulates the Danish language on providing the word for an important new philosophical concept, viz. <i>Gjentagelse</i> (repetition), to replace the foreign word “mediation”. In general, we might regard the Danish language as Kierkegaard’s umbilical attachment to the mother whereas Latin and German represent the law of the father, especially when employed in systematic scholarship or science (<i>Videnskab</i>).</font>

克尔凯郭尔和母亲的关系是不常被评论的，克氏没有在作品中谈论过他的母亲——在他出版的作品与日记中没有直接提及他的母亲，甚至在她去世那天都没有。然而，对于一个如此强调隐喻的作家来说，我们应当将这缺席认作是重要的。攀登者约翰内斯在[《最后的、非科学性的附言》](https://book.douban.com/subject/27131105/)中说：“……多么具有欺骗性啊！一个无处不在的存在，恰恰是通过不可见而被发现。”虽然克氏的母亲是缺席的，但是在丹麦语中（Modersmaal——从词源上说是“母亲”与“措施”的意思）却无处不在。克氏对丹麦语情有独钟，在他的作品中，他一直在努力发挥其母语的优势以抵挡拉丁语和德语的侵略与帝国主义影响。为了这一目的，克尔凯郭尔不得不向丹麦国王请愿：允许他用丹麦语写作哲学论文[《论反讽的概念》](https://book.douban.com/subject/1506334/)。尽管获得了许可，他还是需要使用拉丁语进行公开答辩。拉丁语曾经是整个欧洲都在使用的科学与学术语言。在克氏的时代，德语和德国文化至少与拉丁语一样占据丹麦知识生产的主导地位。而在这种情况之下，克氏陶醉于自己的母语并且创作了一些丹麦语中最优美的诗意散文——包含[《人生道路诸阶段》](https://book.douban.com/subject/27052079/)中一篇对母语的颂歌。在[《重复》](https://book.douban.com/subject/34867987/)中，作为书中人物与假名作者的*坚定的康斯坦丁*祝贺丹麦语中产生了一个重要的新哲学范畴，即*重复*，用来取代外来词mediation。总的来说，我们能够将丹麦语看作是克氏对母亲的脐带关系，而拉丁语与德语则用来表示父亲的权威，特别是用于系统的学术或科学时。

<font face="verdana">The influence of Kierkegaard’s father on his work has been frequently noted. Not only did Kierkegaard inherit his father’s melancholy, his sense of guilt and anxiety, and his pietistic emphasis on the dour aspects of Christian faith, but he also inherited his talents for philosophical argument and creative imagination. In addition Kierkegaard inherited enough of his father’s wealth to allow him to pursue his life as a freelance writer. The themes of sacrificial father/son relationships, of inherited sin, of the burden of history, and of the centrality of the “individual, human existence relationship, the old text, well known, handed down from the fathers” (<i>Postscript</i>) are repeated many times in Kierkegaard’s oeuvre. The father’s sense of guilt was so great (for having cursed God? for having impregnated Kierkegaard’s mother out of wedlock?) that he thought God would punish him by taking the lives of all seven of his children before they reached the age of 34 (the age of Jesus Christ at his crucifixion). This was born out for all but two of the children, Søren and his older brother Peter. Søren was astonished that they both survived beyond that age. This may explain the sense of urgency that drove Kierkegaard to write so prolifically in the years leading up to his 34th birthday.</font>

我们常探讨克尔凯郭尔的父亲对其的影响。克氏不仅继承了他父亲的阴郁，他的罪责感与焦虑，以及他对基督教阴沉而虔诚的信仰，还继承了他在哲学论证与创造性想象的天才。而且，克氏继承了他父亲的财富，这足够支撑他去成为一个自由作家。克氏的作品中不断重复这些主题：牺牲的父子关系<sup>参见亚伯拉罕与以撒的关系</sup>、传承之罪、历史的负担，当然还有“个体性与存在之间的联系、那从父辈流传下来的古老文本”。克尔凯郭尔的父亲罪责感如此沉重（不知是因曾诅咒上帝，还是与未婚配的克氏母亲通奸），以至于他认为上帝会让他的子女在三十四岁（耶稣受难的年龄）时夭折。除了索伦·克尔凯郭尔与他的哥哥彼得，那预言在其他孩子身上都成为了事实。克氏对于他与哥哥的“异常”感到十分震惊。这也许能够解释那紧迫感：驱使克氏在三十四岁生日前几年的高产写作。

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s (broken) engagement to Regine Olsen has also been the focus of much scholarly attention. The theme of a young woman being the occasion for a young man to become “poeticized” recurs in Kierkegaard’s writings, as does the theme of the sacrifice of worldly happiness for a higher (religious) purpose. Kierkegaard’s infatuation with Regine, and the sublimated libidinal energy it lent to his poetic production, were crucial for setting his life course. The breaking of the engagement allowed Kierkegaard to devote himself monastically to his religious purpose, as well as to establish his outsider status (outside the norm of married bourgeois life). It also freed him from close personal entanglements with women, thereby leading him to objectify them as ideal creatures, and to reproduce the patriarchal values of his church and father. The latter included viewing women in terms of their traditional social roles, particularly as mothers and wives, but also in their traditional spiritual roles as epitomes of devotion and self-sacrifice. Nevertheless, whatever one’s life circumstances, social roles and gender, Kierkegaard regarded everyone as equal before God under the aspect of eternity.</font>

克尔凯郭尔与雷吉娜·奥尔森的（破裂）婚约也受到学者的重点关注。年轻女子成为年轻男子“诗意化”的契机、为更高的宗教性的目的而牺牲世俗的情感——这两个主题常常出现在克氏的作品中。克氏对于雷吉娜的迷恋，以及这迷恋给他的诗意作品带来的情欲力量，对确定他的人生道路来说至关重要。解除婚约后，克氏得以全身心地投入其宗教目的，同时还能够建立起局外人的身份（游离于资产阶级婚姻的规范之外）。克氏还因此脱离与女性的私人接触，从而能够将女性看作是理想化的**物品**，并再现了克氏的（从…继承而来）教会/父亲的父权价值观。后者包含从传统社会角色层面看待女性：特别是作为母亲与妻子的女性；但同样包含从传统精神角色层面看待女性：作为奉献与自我牺牲典范的女性。尽管如此，在克氏看来：在那永恒的上帝面前，无论一个人的处境、社会地位和性别如何，人人都是平等的。

###### <font face="verdanna">2. Kierkegaard’s Rhetoric</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s central problematic was <i>how to become a Christian in Christendom</i>. The task was most difficult for the well-educated, since prevailing educational and cultural institutions tended to produce stereotyped members of “the crowd” rather than to allow individuals to discover their own unique identities. This problem was compounded by the fact that Denmark had recently and very rapidly been transformed from a feudal society into a capitalist society. Universal elementary education, large-scale migration from rural areas into cities, and greatly increased social mobility meant that the social structure changed from a rigidly hierarchical one to a relatively “horizontal” one. In this context it became increasingly difficult to “become who you are” for two reasons: (i) social identities were unusually fluid; and (ii) there was a proliferation of normalizing institutions which produced pseudo-individuals.</font>

<font face="verdana">Given this problematic in this social context Kierkegaard perceived a need to invent a form of communication which would not produce stereotyped identities. On the contrary, he needed a form of rhetoric which would force people back onto their own resources, to take responsibility for their own existential choices, and to become who they are beyond their socially imposed identities. In this undertaking Kierkegaard was inspired by the figure of Socrates, whose incessant irony undermined all knowledge claims that were taken for granted or unreflectively inherited from traditional culture. In his dissertation <i>On the Concept of Irony with constant reference to Socrates</i> Kierkegaard argued that the historical Socrates used his irony in order to facilitate the birth of subjectivity in his interlocutors. Because they were constantly forced to abandon their immediate answers to Socrates’ annoying questions, they had to begin to think for themselves and to take individual responsibility for their claims about knowledge and value.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard sought to provide a similar service for his own contemporaries. He used irony, parody, satire, humor, and deconstructive techniques in order to make conventionally accepted forms of knowledge and value untenable. He was a gadfly—constantly irritating his contemporaries with discomforting thoughts. He was also a midwife—assisting at the birth of individual subjectivity by forcing his contemporaries to develop an inner life through critical self-reflection. His art of communication became “the art of <i>taking away</i>” since he thought his audience suffered from too much knowledge rather than too little.</font>

<font face="verdana">Hegelianism promised to make absolute knowledge available by virtue of a science of logic. Anyone with the capacity to follow the dialectical progression of the purportedly transparent concepts of Hegel’s logic would have access to the mind of God (which for Hegel was equivalent to the logical structure of the universe). Kierkegaard thought this to be the hubristic attempt to build a new tower of Babel, or a <i>scala paradisi</i>—a dialectical ladder by which humans can climb with ease up to heaven. Kierkegaard’s strategy was to invert this dialectic by seeking to make everything more difficult. Instead of seeing scientific knowledge as the means of human redemption, he regarded it as the greatest obstacle to redemption. Instead of seeking to give people more knowledge he sought to take away what passed for knowledge. Instead of seeking to make God and Christian faith perfectly intelligible he sought to emphasize the absolute transcendence by God of all human categories. Instead of setting himself up as a religious authority, Kierkegaard used a vast array of textual devices to undermine his authority as an author and to place responsibility for the existential significance to be derived from his texts squarely on the reader.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard distanced himself from his texts by a variety of devices which served to problematize the authorial voice for the reader. He used pseudonyms in many of his works (both overtly aesthetic ones and overtly religious ones). He partitioned the texts into prefaces, forewords, interludes, postscripts, appendices. He assigned the “authorship” of parts of texts to different pseudonyms, and invented further pseudonyms to be the editors or compilers of these pseudonymous writings. Sometimes Kierkegaard appended his name as author, sometimes as the person responsible for publication, sometimes not at all. Sometimes Kierkegaard would publish more than one book on the same day. These simultaneous books embodied strikingly contrasting perspectives. He also published whole <i>series</i> of works simultaneously, viz. the pseudonymous works on the one hand and on the other hand the <i>Edifying Discourses</i> published under his own name.</font>

<font face="verdana">All of this play with narrative point of view, with contrasting works, and with contrasting internal partitions within individual works leaves the reader very disoriented. In combination with the incessant play of irony and Kierkegaard’s predilection for paradox and semantic opacity, the text becomes a polished surface for the reader in which the prime meaning to be discerned is the reader’s own reflection. Christian faith, for Kierkegaard, is not a matter of learning dogma by rote. It is a matter of the individual repeatedly renewing h/er passionate subjective relationship to an object which can never be known, but only believed in. This belief is offensive to reason, since it only exists in the face of the absurd (the paradox of the eternal, immortal, infinite God being incarnated in time as a finite mortal).</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s “method of indirect communication” was designed to sever the reliance of the reader on the authority of the author and on the received wisdom of the community. The reader was to be forced to take individual responsibility for knowing who she is and for knowing where s/he stands on the existential, ethical and religious issues raised in the texts.</font>

<font face="verdana">While much of Kierkegaard’s writing is presented indirectly, under various pseudonyms, he did publish some works under his own name. These works fall into three genres: (i) deliberations; (ii) edifying discourses; and (iii) reviews. The point of indirect communication is to position the reader to relate to the truth with appropriate passion, rather than to communicate the truth as such. In a review, however, it is appropriate to be objective, especially in drawing out a novel’s life-view and life-development. A deliberation (<i>Overveielse</i>), on the other hand, ought to be provocative, and turn the reader’s assumptions topsy-turvy. It draws on irony, the comic and is high-spirited, in order to get thoughts into motion prior to action. A deliberation is a weighing-up, as a propaedeutic to action. An edifying discourse [<i>Opbyggelige Tale</i>], by contrast, “rests in a mood” and presupposes that the reader is already in faith. It seeks to build up the faith that it presupposes. Typically Kierkegaard’s <i>Edifying Discourses</i> invite “that single individual, my reader” to dwell with a biblical passage for the sake of building up faith. Kierkegaard published many of his <i>Edifying Discourses</i> in short collections to accompany particular pseudonymous texts, then later published them again in larger collections. He also published various “Discourses at the Communion on Fridays”, which closely resemble sermons (although they are delivered “without authority”). These are particularly intimate addresses to the sincere Christian, who strives to deepen the subjective passion of faith through confession and through acceptance of divine forgiveness.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard draws attention to Christianity’s “inverted dialectic”, which demands that we exercise “double vision”, to see in worldly things their spiritual opposites, such as hope in hopelessness, strength in weakness and prosperity in adversity. The inverse dialectic also requires that we “reduplicate” our thoughts in our actions, but in so doing that we “work against ourselves”. This was aimed at subverting our focus on worldly goals in order to refocus on other-worldly goals.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s rhetorical play with the inverse Christian dialectic was designed not to make the word of God easier to assimilate, but to establish more clearly the absolute distance that separates human beings from God. This was in order to emphasize that human beings are absolutely reliant on God’s grace for salvation. While most commentators regard Kierkegaard’s view to be that <i>sin</i> is what separates human beings absolutely from God, thereby lending weight to the view that Kierkegaard endorses a particularly dour version of Christianity, a more defensible interpretation is that it is the transcendent God’s capacity to forgive the unforgivable that marks the absolute difference. Our struggle to accept divine forgiveness can become mired in despair, including the second-order despair over the impossibility of forgiveness of our sins and the demonic despair of defiance in which we refuse to accept forgiveness. On the other hand, faith in divine forgiveness can manifest in joy, at the realization that for God anything is possible, including our “rebirth” as spiritual selves with “eternal validity”.</font>

###### <font face="verdanna">3. Kierkegaard’s Aesthetics</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard presents his “first” pseudonymous authorship (<i>Either-Or</i> to <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i>) as a dialectical progression of existential stages. The first is the aesthetic, which gives way to the ethical, which gives way to the religious. The aesthetic stage of existence is characterized by the following: immersion in sensuous experience; valorization of possibility over actuality; egotism; fragmentation of the subject of experience; nihilistic wielding of irony and scepticism; and flight from boredom.</font>

<font face="verdana">The figure of the aesthete in <i>Either-Or</i> (Part One) is an ironic portrayal of German romanticism, but it also draws on medieval characters as diverse as Don Juan, Ahasuerus, and Faust. It finds its most sophisticated form in the author of “The Seducer’s Diary”, the final section of <i>Either-Or</i> (Part One). Johannes the seducer is a <i>reflective aesthete</i>, who gains sensuous delight not so much from the act of seduction but from engineering the possibility of seduction. His real aim is the manipulation of people and situations in ways which generate interesting reflections in his own voyeuristic mind. The aesthetic perspective transforms quotidian dullness into a richly poetic world by whatever means it can. Sometimes the reflective aesthete will inject interest into a book by reading only the last third, or into a conversation by provoking a bore into an apoplectic fit so that he can see a bead of sweat form between the bore’s eyes and run down his nose. That is, the aesthete uses artifice, arbitrariness, irony, and wilful imagination to recreate the world in his own image. The prime motivation for the aesthete is the transformation of the boring into the interesting.</font>

<font face="verdana">This type of aestheticism is criticized from the point of view of ethics. It is seen to be emptily self-serving and escapist. It is a despairing means of avoiding commitment and responsibility. It fails to acknowledge one’s social debt and communal existence. And it is self-deceiving insofar as it substitutes fantasies for actual states of affairs.</font>

<font face="verdana">But Kierkegaard did not want to abandon aesthetics altogether in favor of the ethical and the religious. A key concept in the Hegelian dialectic, which Kierkegaard’s pseudonymous authorship parodies, is <i>Aufhebung</i> (sublation). In Hegel’s dialectic, when contradictory positions are reconciled in a higher unity (synthesis) they are both annulled and preserved (<i>aufgehoben</i>). Similarly with Kierkegaard’s pseudo-dialectic: the aesthetic and the ethical are both annulled and preserved in their synthesis in the religious stage. As far as the aesthetic stage of existence is concerned what is preserved in the higher religious stage is the sense of infinite possibility made available through the imagination. But this no longer excludes what is actual. Nor is it employed for egotistic ends. Aesthetic irony is transformed into religious humor, and the aesthetic <i>transfiguration</i> of the actual world into the ideal is transformed into the religious <i>transubstantiation</i> of the finite world into an actual reconciliation with the infinite.</font>

<font face="verdana">But the dialectic of the “first” pseudonymous authorship never quite reaches the highest, paradoxical form of the religious. We stop short at the <i>representation</i> of the religious by a self-confessed humorist (Johannes Climacus) in a medium which, according to Climacus’s own account, necessarily alienates the reader from true (Christian) faith. For faith is a matter of lived experience, of constant striving within an individual’s existence. According to Climacus’s metaphysics, the world is divided dualistically into the actual and the ideal. Language (and all other media of representation) belong to the realm of the ideal. No matter how eloquent or evocative language is it can never <i>be</i> the actual. Therefore, any representation of faith is always suspended in the realm of ideality and can never <i>be</i> actual faith.</font>

<font face="verdana">So the whole dialectic of the “first” pseudonymous authorship is recuperated by the aesthetic by virtue of its medium of representation. In fact Johannes Climacus acknowledges this implicitly when at the end of <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i> he <i>revokes</i> everything he has said, with the important rider that to say something then to revoke it is not the same as never having said it in the first place. His presentation of religious faith in an aesthetic medium at least provides an opportunity for his readers to make their own leap of faith, by appropriating with inward passion the paradoxical religion of Christianity into their own lives.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard also uses aesthetic devices, including pseudonyms, in his “second” authorship, that is, those published after <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i>. These works include those by Anti-Climacus, who represents the Christian point of view <i>par excellence</i>, beyond where Kierkegaard placed himself. Kierkegaard also used many biblical figures and stories with poignant and striking effect in the religious writings he published under his own name. As a poet of the religious Kierkegaard was always preoccupied with aesthetics. In fact, contrary to popular misconceptions of Kierkegaard which represent him as becoming increasingly hostile to poetry, he increasingly referred to himself as a poet in his later years (all but one of over ninety references to himself as a poet in his journals date from after 1847). Kierkegaard never claimed to write with religious authority, as an apostle. His works represent both less religiously enlightened and more religiously enlightened positions than he thought he had attained in his own existence. Such representations were only possible in an aesthetic medium of imagined possibilities like poetry.</font>

###### <font face="verdanna">4. Kierkegaard’s Ethics</font>

<font face="verdana">Like the terms “aesthetic” and “religious”, the term “ethics” in Kierkegaard’s work has more than one meaning. It is used to denote both: (i) a limited existential sphere, or stage, which is superseded by the higher stage of the religious life; and (ii) an aspect of life which is retained even within the religious life. In the first sense “ethics” is synonymous with the Hegelian notion of <i>Sittlichkeit</i>, or customary mores. In this sense “ethics” represents “the universal”, or more accurately the prevailing social norms. These social norms are used as reasons to make sense of, or justify, an action within a community. Even human sacrifice is justified in terms of how it serves the community, so that when Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter Iphigenia he is regarded as a tragic hero since his community understands that the sacrifice is required by the gods for the success of the Greek expedition to Troy (<i>Fear and Trembling</i>).</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard, however, recognizes duties that cannot be justified in terms of social norms. Much of <i>Fear and Trembling</i> turns on the notion that Abraham’s would-be sacrifice of his son Isaac is ineffable in terms of social norms, and requires a “teleological suspension of the ethical”. That is, Abraham recognizes a duty to something higher than both his social duty not to kill an innocent person and his personal commitment to his beloved son, viz. his duty to obey God’s commands. However, he cannot give an intelligible ethical justification of his act to the community in terms of social norms, but must simply obey the divine command.</font>

<font face="verdana">But in order to arrive at a position of religious faith, which might entail a “teleological suspension of the ethical”, the individual must first embrace the ethical (in the first sense). In order to raise oneself beyond the merely aesthetic life, which is a life of drifting in imagination, possibility and sensation, one needs to make a commitment. That is, the aesthete needs to choose the ethical, which entails a commitment to communication and decision procedures.</font>

<font face="verdana">The ethical position advocated by Judge Wilhelm in “Equilibrium Between the Aesthetic and the Ethical in the Composition of Personality” (<i>Either-Or</i> II) is a peculiar mix of cognitivism and noncognitivism. The metaethics or normative ethics are cognitivist, laying down various necessary conditions for ethically correct action. These conditions include: the necessity of choosing seriously and inwardly; commitment to the belief that predications of good and evil of our actions have a truth-value; the necessity of choosing what one is actually doing, rather than just responding to a situation; actions are to be in accordance with rules; and these rules are universally applicable to moral agents.</font>

<font face="verdana">The choice of metaethics, however, is noncognitive. There is no adequate proof of the truth of metaethics. The choice of normative ethics is motivated, but in a noncognitive way. The Judge seeks to motivate the choice of his normative ethics through the avoidance of despair. Here despair (<i>Fortvivlelse</i>) is to let one’s life depend on conditions outside one’s control (and later, more radically, despair is the very possibility of despair in this first sense). For Judge Wilhelm, the choice of normative ethics is a noncognitive choice of cognitivism, and thereby an acceptance of the applicability of the conceptual distinction between good and evil.</font>

<font face="verdana">From Kierkegaard’s religious perspective, however, the conceptual distinction between good and evil is ultimately dependent not on social norms but on God. Therefore it is possible, as Johannes de Silentio argues was the case for Abraham (the father of faith), that God demand a suspension of the ethical (in the sense of the socially prescribed norms). This is still ethical in the second sense, since ultimately God’s definition of the distinction between good and evil outranks any human society’s definition. The requirement of communicability and clear decision procedures can also be suspended by God’s fiat. This renders cases such as Abraham’s extremely problematic, since we have no recourse to public reason to decide whether he is legitimately obeying God’s command or whether he is a deluded would-be murderer. Since public reason cannot decide the issue for us, we must decide for ourselves as a matter of religious faith.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s ultimate advocacy of divine command metaethics is tempered somewhat by his detailed analyses of the nuanced ways individuals need to relate to God’s commands. These analyses amount to a subtle moral psychology, which borders on virtue ethics. It is not enough simply for God to issue a command; we need to hear and obey. But obedience is not straightforward. We can obey willingly or begrudgingly. We can refuse altogether. We can be selectively deaf, or be so filled with our egotistical desires that we are altogether deaf to our duties. In order to obey we first need to cultivate faith, since obedience to a divine command is nonsense unless we at least believe the command has come from God. To cultivate faith in a transcendent, eternal, omnipresent God, who allegedly became incarnate in the form of a particular human being who was put to death, requires one to overcome the offense to one’s reason and to adopt a tolerance for paradox. To imagine the enormity of the consequences of sin, yet to relish the possibilities of freedom, engenders anxiety. We need to learn to navigate the treacherous maelstroms of despair, to recognize the self-absorption of demonic states, to veer away from prudence and vanity, and to avoid mere conformity to social mores. We need to cultivate hope, patience, devotion, and above all love. But we also need to be vigilant about our capacity for self-deception and be prepared to suffer for love and for our ultimate spiritual identity.</font>

###### <font face="verdanna">5. Kierkegaard’s Religion</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard styled himself above all as a religious poet. The religion to which he sought to relate his readers is Christianity. The type of Christianity that underlies his writings is a very serious strain of Lutheran pietism informed by the dour values of sin, guilt, suffering, and individual responsibility. Kierkegaard was immersed in these values in the family home through his father, whose own childhood was lived in the shadow of <i>Herrnhut</i> pietism in Jutland. Kierkegaard’s father subsequently became a member of the lay Congregation of Brothers (<i>Brødremenighed</i>) in Copenhagen, which he and his family attended in addition to the sermons by Bishop J. P. Mynster.</font>

<font face="verdana">For Kierkegaard Christian faith is not a matter of regurgitating church dogma. It is a matter of individual subjective passion, which cannot be mediated by the clergy or by human artefacts. Faith is the most important task to be achieved by a human being, because only on the basis of faith does an individual have a chance to become a true self. This self is the life-work which God judges for eternity.</font>

<font face="verdana">The individual is thereby subject to an enormous burden of responsibility, for upon h/er existential choices hangs h/er eternal salvation or damnation. Anxiety or dread (<i>Angest</i>) is the presentiment of this terrible responsibility when the individual stands at the threshold of momentous existential choice. Anxiety is a two-sided emotion: on one side is the dread burden of choosing for eternity; on the other side is the exhilaration of freedom in choosing oneself. Choice occurs in the instant (<i>Øieblikket</i>), which is the point at which time and eternity intersect—for the individual creates through temporal choice a self which will be judged for eternity.</font>

<font face="verdana">But the choice of faith is not made once and for all. It is essential that faith be constantly renewed by means of repeated avowals of faith. One’s very selfhood depends upon this repetition, for according to Anti-Climacus, the self “is a relation which relates itself to itself” (<i>The Sickness Unto Death</i>). But unless this self acknowledges a “power which constituted it,” it falls into a despair which undoes its selfhood. Therefore, in order to maintain itself as a relation which relates itself to itself, the self must constantly renew its faith in “the power which posited it.” There is no <i>mediation</i> between the individual self and God by priest or by logical system (<i>contra</i> Catholicism and Hegelianism respectively). There is only the individual’s own <i>repetition</i> of faith. This repetition of faith is the way the self relates itself to itself and to the power which constituted it, i.e., the repetition of faith <i>is</i> the self.</font>

<font face="verdana">Christian dogma, according to Kierkegaard, embodies paradoxes which are offensive to reason. The central paradox is the assertion that the eternal, infinite, transcendent God simultaneously became incarnated as a temporal, finite, human being (Jesus). There are two possible attitudes we can adopt to this assertion, viz. we can have faith, or we can take offense. What we cannot do, according to Kierkegaard, is believe by virtue of reason. If we choose faith we must suspend our reason in order to believe in something higher than reason. In fact we must believe <i>by virtue of the absurd</i>.</font>

<font face="verdana">Much of Kierkegaard’s authorship explores the notion of the absurd: Job gets everything back again by virtue of the absurd (<i>Repetition</i>); Abraham gets a reprieve from having to sacrifice Isaac, by virtue of the absurd (<i>Fear and Trembling</i>); Kierkegaard hoped to get Regine back again after breaking off their engagement, by virtue of the absurd (<i>Journals</i>); Climacus hopes to deceive readers into the truth of Christianity by virtue of an absurd representation of Christianity’s ineffability; the Christian God is represented as absolutely transcendent of human categories yet is absurdly presented as a personal God with the human capacities to love, judge, forgive, teach, etc. Kierkegaard’s notion of the absurd subsequently became an important category for twentieth century existentialists, though usually devoid of its religious associations.</font>

<font face="verdana">According to Johannes Climacus, faith is a miracle, a gift from God whereby eternal truth enters time in the instant. This Christian conception of the relation between (eternal) truth and time is distinct from the Socratic notion that (eternal) truth is always already within us—it just needs to be recovered by means of recollection (<i>anamnesis</i>). The condition for realizing (eternal) truth for the Christian is a gift (<i>Gave</i>) from God, but its realization is a task (<i>Opgave</i>) which must be repeatedly performed by the individual believer. Whereas Socratic recollection is a recuperation of the past, Christian repetition is a “recollection forwards”—so that the eternal (future) truth is captured in time.</font>

<font face="verdana">Crucial to the miracle of Christian faith is the realization that over against God we are always in the wrong. That is, we must realize that we are always in sin. This is the condition for faith, and must be given by God. The idea of sin cannot evolve from purely human origins. Rather, it must have been introduced into the world from a transcendent source. Once we understand that we are in sin, we can understand that there is some being over against which we are always in the wrong. On this basis we can have faith that, by virtue of the absurd, we can ultimately be atoned with this being. The absurdity of atonement requires faith that we believe that for God even the impossible is possible, including the forgiveness of the unforgivable. If we can accept God’s forgiveness, sincerely, inwardly, contritely, with gratitude and hope, then we open ourselves to the joyous prospect of beginning anew. The only obstacle to this joy is our refusal or resistance to accepting God’s forgiveness properly. Although God can forgive the unforgivable, He cannot force anyone to accept it. Therefore, for Kierkegaard, “there is only one guilt that God cannot forgive, that of not willing to believe in his greatness!”.</font>

###### <font face="verdanna">6. Kierkegaard’s Politics</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard is sometimes regarded as an apolitical thinker, but in fact he intervened stridently in church politics, cultural politics, and in the turbulent social changes of his time. His earliest published essay, for example, was a polemic against women’s liberation. It is a reactionary apologetic for the prevailing patriarchal values, and was motivated largely by Kierkegaard’s desire to ingratiate himself with factions within Copenhagen’s intellectual circles. This latter desire gradually left him, but his relation to women remained highly questionable.</font>

<font face="verdana">One of Kierkegaard’s main interventions in cultural politics was his sustained attack on Hegelianism. Hegel’s philosophy had been introduced into Denmark with religious zeal by J.L. Heiberg, and was taken up enthusiastically within the theology faculty of Copenhagen University and by Copenhagen’s literati. Kierkegaard, too, was induced to make a serious study of Hegel’s work. While Kierkegaard greatly admired Hegel, he had grave reservations about Hegelianism and its bombastic promises. Hegel would have been the greatest thinker who ever lived, said Kierkegaard, if only he had regarded his system as a thought-experiment. Instead he took himself seriously to have reached the truth, and so rendered himself comical.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s tactic in undermining Hegelianism was to produce an elaborate parody of Hegel’s entire system. The pseudonymous authorship, from <i>Either-Or</i> to <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i>, presents an inverted Hegelian dialectic which is designed to take away readers’ presumed knowledge rather than add to it. This authorship snipes simultaneously at German romanticism and contemporary Danish literati (with J.L. Heiberg receiving much acerbic comment). However, it also draws heavily on the work of these authors, especially by taking seriously their framing of philosophical and theological problems. For example, Kierkegaard engaged with the early German romantics’ notion that modernity is to be understood primarily by contrast with antiquity, which in turn is to be understood mainly in terms of classical Greek thought. Classical Greek art, in particular, is taken to be the gold standard by which artistic perfection is to be measured. However, Kierkegaard and the German romantics and German idealists share the view that classical Greek art lacks inwardness or subjective spirit. Modern art, by contrast, while unlikely to match the formal perfection of classical Greek art, contains the potential to explore subjective spirit. One crucial dimension of subjective spirit is freedom, which becomes a distinctive preoccupation of modern art and post-Kantian philosophy. Kierkegaard’s concept of individual freedom, ultimately understood in terms of becoming as nothing before God, engages critically with the concepts of freedom in Kant, Hegel and Schelling, as well as with the theologies of Jacobi, Lessing and Schleiermacher. Kierkegaard presents a distinctive phenomenology of freedom by means of fictional case studies in a method he calls “experimenting psychology”. He uses narrative points of view, pseudonyms, vignettes, character sketches and case studies from life and literature to illustrate how dialectics of moods, emotions and spirit can both disable and enable individual freedom. Moods such as melancholy, boredom and irony can become demonically self-perpetuating, but they also have the potential to lift the individual to a state of self-reflection that amounts to higher order consciousness, thereby enabling the individual to see his or her former existence as what Wittgenstein called a limited whole. The highest order of consciousness for Kierkegaard is God-consciousness, which enables the individual to see himself or herself as both a sinner and as open to divine grace. The path to this ultimate freedom requires will, imagination, faith, love, penitence, patience and a humble kenosis, whereby the self is emptied of will to become receptive to God’s will.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s intriguing pseudonymous “first authorship”, culminating in <i>Concluding Unscientific Postscript</i>, received little popular attention, aimed as it was at the literary elite. So it had little immediate effect as discursive action. Kierkegaard sought to remedy this by provoking an attack on himself in the popular satirical review <i>The Corsair</i>. Kierkegaard succeeded in having himself mercilessly lampooned in this publication, largely on personal grounds rather than in terms of the substance of his writings. The suffering incurred by these attacks sparked Kierkegaard into another highly productive phase of authorship, but this time his focus was the creation of positive Christian discourses rather than satire or parody.</font>

<font face="verdana">Eventually Kierkegaard became more and more worried about the direction taken by the Danish People’s Church, especially after the death of the Bishop Primate J.P. Mynster. He realized he could no longer indulge himself in the painstakingly erudite and poetically meticulous writing he had practised hitherto. He had to intervene decisively in a popular medium, so he published his own pamphlet under the title <i>The Instant</i> or <i>The Moment</i> (<i>Øieblikket</i>). This addressed church politics directly and increasingly shrilly.</font>

<font face="verdana">There were two main foci of Kierkegaard’s concern in church politics. One was the influence of Hegel, largely through the teachings of H.L. Martensen; the other was the popularity of N.F.S. Grundtvig, a theologian, educator and poet who composed most of the pieces in the Danish hymn book. Grundtvig’s theology was diametrically opposed to Kierkegaard’s in tone. Grundtvig emphasized the light, joyous, celebratory and communal aspects of Christianity, whereas Kierkegaard emphasized seriousness, suffering, sin, guilt, and individual isolation. Kierkegaard’s intervention failed miserably with respect to the Danish People’s Church, which became predominantly Grundtvigian. His intervention with respect to Hegelianism also failed, with Martensen succeeding Mynster as Bishop Primate. Hegelianism in the church went on to die of natural causes.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard also provided critical commentary on social change. He was an untiring champion of “the single individual” as opposed to “the crowd”. He feared that the opportunity of achieving genuine selfhood was diminished by the social production of stereotypes. He lived in an age when mass society was emerging from a highly stratified feudal order and was contemptuous of the mediocrity the new social order generated. One symptom of the change was that mass society substitutes detached reflection for engaged passionate commitment. Yet the latter is crucial for Christian faith and for authentic selfhood according to Kierkegaard.</font>

<font face="verdana">Kierkegaard’s real value as a social and political thinker was not realized until after his death. His pamphleteering achieved little immediate impact, but his substantial philosophical, literary, psychological and theological writings have had a lasting effect. Much of Heidegger’s very influential work, <i>Being And Time</i>, is indebted to Kierkegaard’s writings, especially for its phenomenology of moods and its understanding of the constitutive role of time in the formation of the subject. Sartre’s equally large tome, <i>Being And Nothingness</i>, in which the freedom of the individual becomes the primary concept for social and political explanation, also draws on Kierkegaard. Sartre’s associated notions of authenticity and bad faith, and his assertion that existence precedes essence, also have Kierkegaardian origins. Adorno, on the other hand, in his <i>Habilitationsschrift</i>, later published as <i>Kierkegaard: Construction of the Aesthetic</i>, is critical of Kierkegaard’s politics, though Adorno’s indirect target was Heidegger and existentialism more generally. Adorno argues that Kierkegaard’s philosophy of inwardness ultimately reflects only the bourgeois interior of his time, and that Kierkegaard falls into the idealism he sought to escape because, like the existentialists, he fails to follow a concrete historical dialectic. This results in Kierkegaard’s subject-object dialectic positing an abstract self as counterweight to the abstractness of the universal. Kierkegaard thereby fails to understand the self in terms of its concrete historical situation and, despite his best intentions, creates a self-contradictory system of existence, which in turn prepares the ground for Heidegger’s ontology.</font>

<font face="verdana">Contrary to Adorno’s critique, it could be argued that Kierkegaard’s writing evinces an astute social realism, evident in myriad concrete observations and critical reflections on everyday life and on institutions such as the church, the press, the democratic movement and the women’s movement. This critical social realism, along with his deep psychological and philosophical analyses of contemporary problems, and his concern to address “the present age” were taken up by fellow Scandinavians Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg. Ibsen and Strindberg, together with Friedrich Nietzsche, became central icons of the modernism movement in Berlin in the 1890s. The Danish literary critic Georg Brandes was instrumental in conjoining these intellectual figures: he had given the first university lectures on Kierkegaard and on Nietzsche; he had promoted Kierkegaard’s work to Nietzsche and to Strindberg; and he had put Strindberg in correspondence with Nietzsche. Taking his cue from Brandes, the Swedish literary critic Ola Hansson subsequently promoted this conjunction of writers in Berlin itself. Berlin modernism self-consciously sought to use art as a means of political and social change. It continued Kierkegaard’s concern to use discursive action for social transformation.</font>

<font face="verdana">Many other writers have been inspired by Kierkegaard to tackle fundamental issues in philosophy, politics, theology and psychology. One major inspiration has been Kierkegaard’s treatment of Abraham and the sacrifice of Isaac (the Akkedah). Franz Kafka, Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida have all written extensively in response, to try to sort out the implications for ethics and faith. Gabriel Marcel, Lev Shestov, Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, Gyorgy Lukacs, Karl Barth, Georges Battaille, Rudolf Bultmann, Karl Jaspers, Michel Henry and John D. Caputo have all been influenced by, or engaged with, Kierkegaard’s Christian existentialism. Carl Schmitt’s political theology uses concepts such as “the decision” and “the exception”, which draw heavily on Kierkegaard’s concepts of “the moment” and “repetition”. Kierkegaard was also an inspiration for the early Wittgenstein, who reportedly said Kierkegaard was “by far the most profound thinker of the [nineteenth] century. Kierkegaard was a saint.” Subsequent Wittgensteinians, such as Stanley Cavell, James Conant and Cora Diamond, have all engaged with aspects of Kierkegaard’s work, including how we should understand the distinction between sense and nonsense in the context of claims about religious authority and revelation. Alastair MacIntyre’s reading of Kierkegaard in <i>After Virtue</i> and <i>A Short History of Ethics</i> opened up a vigorous line of inquiry into Kierkegaard’s relevance for ethics in contemporary analytic philosophy. This has produced quite a debate about the relevance of Kierkegaard for developing narrative accounts of the self, with notable contributions by Anthony Rudd, John Davenport, John Lippitt and Patrick Stokes. Paul Ricoeur and Judith Butler have also been influenced by Kierkegaard, especially regarding his use of rhetoric and narrative point of view to critique systematic philosophy.</font>

<font face="verdana">It is impossible to give an exhaustive list of the important thinkers who owe an intellectual or existential debt to Kierkegaard. The diversity of the writers and thinkers mentioned above nevertheless testifies to the breadth and depth of his influence, which continues into the present age.</font>
