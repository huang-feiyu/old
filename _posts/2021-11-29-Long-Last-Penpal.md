###### Letter 1

Hello

Do you remember me?

你好，你还记得我吗？

I am your long lost pen pal

我是你多年不见的笔友

It must have been ten years ago we last wrote

距离上一次我们相互写信，应该有十年了

I don't really know what happened

我不知道发生了什么

I guess life came in the way

或许，生活就是这样

Let me know if you're still alive

请让我知道你是否还活着

Let me know if you ever used that knife or not

请让我知道你是否还用过那把小刀

###### Letter 2

Hello

Yes, I remember you

你好，我还记得你

I've got a husband and two children now

如今我已有了一个丈夫和两个孩子

I work as an accountant and make fairly good money

我现在是一个会计，有着不错的薪水

I still have your letters, you used a pink pen to write them

我仍然保留着你的信件，那些你用粉色的笔写的信

And you would comfort me

When my tears would stain the ink

当我的泪水沾湿信纸的时候，你总是会安慰我

And I would send you mix tapes with Kate Bush on

而且我会送你Kate Bush的磁带

---

I have to admit I sometimes lied in those letters

Tried to make life better than it was

我承认自己在那些信中说过谎，努力想让生活看起来更好一些

I still wasn't kissed at sixteen

我十六岁时还没有接过吻

And I still need a friend

我还需要一个朋友

---

There was this letter

I never told you this back then

我从未告诉你，这一封信

But it would be fair to say it saved my life

它挽救了我的生命：

I sat in the window

我坐在窗边

The only one left out from a party again

又是唯一一个被派对遗弃的人

Pretty sure I didn't have a single friend

我十分确信，我没有一个朋友

Then I checked the mailbox

然后，我看了看邮箱

###### Letter 3

Dear long lost penpal

亲爱的朋友：

I was lying the whole time

我一直都在说谎

I'm really a 46 years old man named Luke

我其实是一个46岁的男人，名字叫做Luke

I have three children

And a wife, she doesn't care

我有三个孩子和一个并不在意我的妻子

And I hope you don't resent me

我请求你不要再回信了

And I hope you do not hate me

同时，我请求你不要恨我

For trying to find my way back to what it's like to be young

我只是想要找到年轻的感觉，才说了谎……

I have to admit I sometimes lied in those letters

Tried to make life better than it was

我承认自己在那些信中说过谎，努力想让生活看起来更好一些

I still wasn't kissed at sixteen

我十六岁时还没有接过吻

And I still need a friend

我还需要一个朋友
